## Multiple Instance Learning Networks for Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis

This repository will soon hold the implementations of the methods presented in our paper:

> _In Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL)_.<br/>
> [ [pdf](http://aclweb.org/anthology/Q18-1002) ]

We are currently re-implementing the paper's models in PyTorch, as our original (Lua)Torch implementation appears to be problematic for particular GPUs (very slow training times). If you would still like to access our Torch code, please contact me at: s [dot] angelidis [at] ed [dot] ac [dot] uk.

### SPOT data

The newly annotated SPOT dataset used in the above paper is already available on the 
EdinburghNLP github page: [link](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/spot-data)
